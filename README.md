This project is a dynamic music recommendation website called Moodify, designed to enhance user experience by allowing music selection based on different moods—Happy, Chill, Energetic, and Romantic. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website features an intuitive sidebar for mood selection and a visually appealing rain animation effect in the background to create an immersive atmosphere. Users can browse curated playlists tailored to each mood, play individual songs, or enjoy the entire playlist sequentially with a convenient “Play All” button. This project was developed as my first-year mini project, reflecting my early passion for music and web technologies.
